# Cellular-Automaton

Cellular Automaton is a system similar to Conway's game of life. Unlike Conway's game of life however, each row represents "passing of time" or new generation. More information here: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html

In this implementation of cellular Automaton, rather than using simply two colors to represent on and off state, I used a series of closely related colors to represent the two states to create a more aesthetically pleasing.
